Postgresql 8.0 or better:

Simply use the pgxs GNU makefile provided:

	sh> make install

You must only insure that the pg_config found in your path is the one
of the target postgresql server.

If you are fed up, you can remove all installed files with:

	sh> make uninstall



For prior versions:

There is no reason why it should not work with other versions of PostgreSQL.
Look at the postgresql documentation for compiling manually the C files
into shared objects, for fixing the sql loading scripts, and for installing
the stuff where expected.

Alternativelly, you can copy all files in a contrib/pg_comparator directory
within the PostgreSQL source tree, fix the makefile by looking at other
contrib makefiles for defining proper macros and including some files, 
and then make install/uninstall as above after PostgreSQL has been 
properly configured.
